# To Do

X build a lucidchart flow chart thing
X Start main.rs
X build some SQL insertion functions
X parse JMDict_b
X insert parsed data into database
X search functionality...
X make sure you have indexes on the things you need indexes for i.e. entries, kanji keb, reading reb, 
X materialised lookup table for entries
X play around with tauri
X edit entry_full and gloss_entry tables so that they only display one kanji, (by kanji priority)
- display japanese entries in initial search
- create a "japanese entry" page
- spruce up the look a little...
- import more data into database
    - concat strings for most of sense data probably
    X kanji has some info it needs like priority, whether it's outdated
    - readings have info as well
    - lots can be a string that can be parsed at runtime probably...
